## Introduction

In this exercise, you will calculate a subtotal and total price of the
contents of a shopping cart.

## Getting Started

```no-highlight
$ cd ~/challenges
$ et get checkout-line-js
$ cd checkout-line-js
```

Open the `checkoutLine.js` file in your editor.

## Instructions

You have been provided an array of items named `shoppingCart`. Each item object has the following properties:

* itemName
* quantity
* price

## What's the price?

Write code to answer the following questions about the items in the shopping cart:

* How much is one pound (lb.) of coffee?
* How many gallons of milk are in the shopping cart?

{% show_solution %}
```javascript
// if we know the index of the array:
console.log(`One pound of coffee is $${shoppingCart[3].price}.`)
console.log(`There are ${shoppingCart[1].quantity} gallon(s) of milk in the shopping cart.`)

// if we only know the name of the product we are looking for...
coffee = shoppingCart.find((item) => item.itemName === 'lbs. of coffee')
milk = shoppingCart.find((item) => item.itemName === 'gallon of milk')
console.log(`One pound of coffee is $${coffee.price}.`)
console.log(`There are ${milk.quantity} gallon(s) of milk in the shopping cart.`)
```
{% endshow_solution %}

## Subtotal and Total

Iterate over the array, and calculate the sub-total of the items in the shopping cart. This would be the total cost of the items **without tax**. Print this value to the console.

Next, calculate the total cost of the items, **including tax**. Use 6.25% as the tax rate.

{% show_hint %}
You can use a `for` loop, or the `forEach` method to iterate over the shoppingCart array.
{% endshow_hint %}

{% show_solution %}
```javascript
const TAX_RATE = 6.25
let subTotal = 0
shoppingCart.forEach((item) => {
  subTotal += item.price * item.quantity
})
console.log(`subtotal: $${subTotal}`)
console.log(`total: $${subTotal * (1 + (TAX_RATE / 100))}`)
```
{% endshow_solution %}
