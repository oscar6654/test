    question: 'What is Launch Academy?',
    answer: 'Launch Academy is a 10-week, immersive bootcamp taking eager learners with little to no coding experience and giving them the tools to add value as a junior contributor to a software engineering team'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: 'What kind of people are you looking for?',
    answer: "You are highly motivated to learn and naturally curious. You don't give up easily, ever. You maintain an inner force that drives you to build something beautiful someday which will make an impact on the world. You play well with others and are kind. You often want to help those around you. You're super excited about learning to code."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: 'Will I have a chance at succeeding?',
    answer: "If you are motivated and enthusiastic about learning technology, then yes, you will. You don't need a special cape or a magic wand to be a programmer. You don't need advanced math or calculus. Programming is a language and a way of thinking. Anybody who wants to learn to program proficiently can do so. If you are accepted, that means we see something special in you. We won't settle for anything less."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: 'What Languages do you teach? What will I learn?',
    answer: 'We give you exposure to the full stack. You’ll learn Javascript, Ruby, HTML/CSS, and SQL. But learning the languages isn’t really that helpful unless you also know the frameworks in which to apply them. You’ll get experience applying the programming languages you learn in frameworks like Rails, Sinatra, Capybara, JQuery, and PostgreSQL'
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: 'Why should I learn to program?',
    answer: 'Even non-technical jobs are beginning to require basic programming knowledge. Knowing how to write and think in code is quickly becoming one of the most essential skills in the job market. But the rewards of learning to program go deeper than just getting a better job. Code has innumerable touchpoints in your daily life, and understanding the underlying logic of the programmable world around you means you’ll have a deeper understanding of the everyday magic found in modern life.'
