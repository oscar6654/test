## Introduction

In this exercise, you will create an HTML and CSS template which you can
easily apply to any of the web applications you build.

You will practice adding color, choosing typefaces, and working with a CSS grid
system to create a styling template.

## Tips

Give yourself a stylistic theme to emulate. Do you want your webpage to look
like it came out of a futuristic science fiction film? Perhaps would like to evoke
feelings of the 60s era by creating a website themed after the Beatles
[Yellow Submarine](https://www.google.com/search?q=beatles+yellow+submarine&tbm=isch)?

Once you have chosen a target styling goal, apply color, typography, and a grid
to achieve your goal. Add images as well, if you would like.

You may create multiple style templates. Simply move the folder containing this
exercise and grab a new copy of it.

```bash
$ mv ~/challenges/define-your-style ~/challenges/retro-60s-template
$ et get define-your-style
```

Change some of the content and structure of the page to correlate with the
stylistic theme you have chosen.

## Usage in Other Applications

Once you nail down a style that fits your theme, simply copy over the `style.css`
and the code from the `<head>` in the `index.html` document over to your
application.
